Following instructions from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest

I installed the Adafruit Circuit stuff doing:
"sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mcp3xxx"

Personally I don't like using pip because you end up with things at different levels
Didn't seem to be another option though.
